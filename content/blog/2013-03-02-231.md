Sometimes, I realized there are actually a lot of channels to promote myself. Just like the page on <a href="http://http://about.me/zhouyiyan">about.me</a>, I got constant page views in the past several weeks. Probably because I use an interesting photo as the background, that I took, probably many years ago, with pigeons in the local park. I did check the pages on that site, they all seem fancy and beautiful, maybe most of them are working in art of design area. So it might help promote my page too, by using a good picture.

Besides, I also got this blog, Github profile, my Linked-in profile, and probably other sites that contain my personal information. I believe the power of public profile but I still don't get the clues how to maintain them in a consistent and continuous way. Several former classmate inspired me to build those various public sites. One is an active member for Python China community, and a contributor for one Go language IDE. Another was working for MS, and have a blog that has many visitors. Both of them are now in Google, but in different places around the world. Sometimes, I just envy them but I understand the effort they have invested in reaching the current status.

Anyway, I would just keep on going, trying to prepare myself for any future challenges and opportunities.
