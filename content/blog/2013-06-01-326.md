This is the second time that I have been impressed by the word, "simple". First, "Simple Made Easy", by Clojure's invetor, Rich Hickey. And now, "ridicuously simple", by Ã˜MQ's creators. I feel vigorated because I share the same dream that one day, software can connect with each other, not only by those big companies, but also by individuals. Software can talk to each other to obtain more insights, knowledges, capabilities, and it also starts from basic network. Pretty amazing, huh?
