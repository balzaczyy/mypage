Unfortunately here comes the day that I decide to temporarily pause my migration work of GoLucene and swtich my focus to a more interesting project. I know it's been a big hole that I dug (and a even larger one, when I decided to migrate the whole Lucene code base...), but due to the change of my day project, the incentive is now not strong enough to sustain my continuous effort. It's time to move on.

I'm now working on a more cloud related project, which has a Go command-line client, BTW. But the prototype team used Java to develop a web portal with similar functions used in its Go command-lien client. So I can't help producing a Go clone of this prototype, to improve code reuse, and to kill my personal time, too.

It would take about 5 months to do the work, which also means I might resume my GoLucene migration in June. So wish me luck!
